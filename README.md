# Installer script for ParrotOS

This project stands as a replacement for the [alternate-install](https://github.com/ParrotSec/alternate-install) which is no longer maintained. It is updated to the latest Parrot release.

## How to use

Its use is quite simple:

1. open a terminal window
2. clone this repository
3. run `sudo chmod +x ./installer.sh`
4. type `./installer.sh`

A menu will open:

    ========== ParrotOS Editions Installer ==========
    1) Install Core Edition
    2) Install Home Edition
    3) Install Security Edition
    4) Install Hack The Box Edition
    5) Install headless packages
    6) Exit
    =================================================

You will need to choose the option by typing a number, such as 1 to install the core edition packages.

Tested on Debian 12 (virtual machines and Docker containers).
